Adds syntax highlighting of [Stan](http://mc-stan.org/) files in [Atom](https://atom.io/).

Originally the grammar was converted from the [sublime-stan](https://github.com/dougalsutherland/sublime-stan) Stan package.

This is just a bare-bones package, and my primary purpose is to have a grammar definition
compatible with [linguist](https://github.com/github/linguist), which github uses to detect
and highlight code.
